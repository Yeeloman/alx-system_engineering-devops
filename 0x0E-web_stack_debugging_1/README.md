# Web Stack Debugging #1

This repository is part of a series of web stack debugging projects, specifically the second one. In each project, I was presented with malfunctioning web stacks within isolated containers and tasked with rectifying the issues to restore the web stack to a functional state. For each challenge, I created a script automating the necessary commands to address the specific problems in the web stack.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Nginx likes port 80**
  * [0-nginx_likes_port_80](./0-nginx_likes_port_80): This Bash script is designed to configure Nginx, ensuring it runs and listens on port 80 for all active IPv4 addresses on the server.

* **1. Make it sweet and short**
  * [1-debugging_made_short](./1-debugging_made_short): The Bash script in this task focuses on configuring Nginx to listen specifically to port 80 without running on all active IPv4 addresses on the server.
