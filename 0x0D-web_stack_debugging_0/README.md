## Web Stack Debugging #0

This project marked the beginning of a series focused on debugging and fixing broken web stacks within isolated containers. The main objective was to troubleshoot and rectify various issues in order to restore the web stack to a functional state. For each task, a script was created to automate the necessary commands and procedures to address the identified problems.

## Task:

### 0. Give me a page!
* Script: [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page)
* Description: Bash script designed to execute Apache on a web server and ensure its responsiveness to queries made to the root.
